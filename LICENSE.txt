provided You retain all Notices.

irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source available from a
Source Location should You Convey a Product in circumstances where the
recipient does not otherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source. In
each case subsection 2.2.3 shall apply. You may only delete Notices if they are


no longer applicable to the corresponding Covered Source as modified by You
and You may add additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.

2.2.3. You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You shall also
become a Licensor) provided that You:

2.2.3.1. retain Notices as required in subsection 2.2.2;

modified it, with the date and brief description of how You have

remain licensed under their own applicable licenses.

2.3.   Making and Conveying Products

2.3.1. You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either provide
each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure that each recipient
is notified of the Source Location of the Complete Source. That Complete
Source includes Covered Source and You must accordingly satisfy Your
obligations set out in Section 2.2.2. If specified in a Notice, the Product must
visibly and securely display the Source Location on it or its packaging or
documentation in the manner specified in that Notice.

2.4.1. You may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to a
legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance work on Your
behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which prevent the entity
from both using the Source or Products for its own internal purposes and
Conveying the Source or Products or any modifications to them to any person
other than You. Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be
made by You pursuant to subsection 2.2.2.

2.5.   Disclaimer and Liability

2.5.1. The Covered Source and any Products are provided as-is and as-available and
any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied
warranties of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third-party rights, and


fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source
or Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no
representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any
patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the
use, quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and
not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this License
to the Product and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this
License to the Product.

2.5.2. The Licensor shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability
for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or
other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of
substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business
interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort
(including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in
relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making or
Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages,
and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,
damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to
such use.

2.5.3. The Licensee shall use all reasonable care to protect its own safety and health
and the safety and health of persons affected by its acts or omissions in
handling the Product.

they may suffer in connection with the handling of the Product.

be excluded and the Licensee’s claims may not be lawfully waived, but the
Licensor’s liability may be limited, it holds that the entire obligation of the
Licensor to compensate for damage shall be limited to the amount paid by the
Licensee for using the Product, or to the amount of USD 10.

2.6.  Patents

2.6.1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License to the Product.

counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or You seek any
declaration that a patent licensed to You under this License to the Product is
invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this License to the
Product shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated.

image, or logo by which the Licensor is known, except where needed to comply
with section 2.2, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such
permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind
of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.

2.7.3. This License to the Product shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to
comply with any of its terms and conditions.

2.7.4. This License to the Product shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting
as such, and third-party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.

3.   PROGRAM

3.1.   Scope of the License

3.1.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License to the Program, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-
exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the licensed rights in the Licensed
Program to:

3.1.1.1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Program, in whole or in part, for
non-commercial purposes only; and

3.1.1.2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for non-commercial
purposes only.

3.1.2. For the avoidance of doubt, where exceptions and limitations apply to Your use,
this License to the Program does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
its terms and conditions.

3.1.3. The term of this License to the Program is specified in 3.5.1.

3.1.4. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
necessary to exercise the Licensed rights, including technical modifications
necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of
this License to the Program, simply making modifications authorized by this
Section 3.1.4 never produces Adapted Material.

3.1.5. Every recipient of the Licensed Program automatically receives an offer from
the Licensor to exercise the Licensed rights under the terms and conditions of
this License to the Program.

3.1.6. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on,
or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Program if
doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed rights by any recipient of the
Licensed Program.


3.1.7. Nothing in this License to the Program constitutes or may be construed as
permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Program is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3.2.2.1.1.

3.1.8. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this License to
the Program, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights;
however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to
allow You to exercise the Licensed rights, but not otherwise.

3.1.6. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License to the Program.

3.1.10. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from
You for the exercise of the Licensed rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Program is used other
than for non-commercial purposes.

3.2.   License Conditions

3.2.1. Your exercise of the Licensed rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

3.2.2. If You Share the Licensed Program (including in modified form), You must:

and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including

License to the Program.

3.2.3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3.2.3 in any reasonable manner based
on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Program.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI
or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.


3.2.4. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3.2.2.1 to the extent reasonably practicable.

3.2.5. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
License to the Program.

3.3.   Sui Generis Database Rights

3.3.1. Where the Licensed rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Program:

3.3.1.1. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 3.1.1 grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for non-commercial purposes only;

3.3.1.2. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

3.3.1.3. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3.2.2 if You Share all
or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

3.3.2. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.3 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this License to the Program where the Licensed rights
include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

3.4.   Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

3.4.1. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Program as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Program, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

3.4.2. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal
theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,
special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other
losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License to the Program
or use of the Licensed Program, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

3.4.3. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be
interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates
an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

3.5.   Term and Termination

3.5.1. This License to the Program applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License to the


Program, then Your rights under this License to the Program terminate
automatically.

3.5.2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Program has terminated under Section
3.5.1, it reinstates:

within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

3.5.2.2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

3.5.3. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.5.2 does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License to the
Program.

3.5.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Program
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Program
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License to the Program.

3.5.5. Sections 1; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6 and 3.7 survive termination of this License to the
Program.

3.6.   Other Terms and Conditions

3.6.1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

Program not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this License to the Program.

3.7.  Interpretation

3.7.1. For the avoidance of doubt, this License to the Program does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Program that could lawfully be made without permission under this
License to the Program.

3.7.2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this License to the Program is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this License to the Program without affecting the enforceability
of the remaining terms and conditions.

3.7.3. No term or condition of this License to the Program will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

3.7.4. Nothing in this License to the Program constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.
